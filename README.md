# Introduction to Project 1

## Project Objective
Develop a predictive model to determine the probability of each customer subscribing to one of the loyalty program cards (**Star**, **Nova**, or **Aurora**). This will help sales representatives optimize their approach and increase efficiency in the sales process.

## 1. The Business Problem

### 1.1. Context
An airline seeks to expand its loyalty program membership, which offers three levels of benefits through the cards: 
- **Star**: Basic level with fewer benefits.
- **Nova**: Intermediate level.
- **Aurora**: Advanced level with more benefits.

The goal is to prioritize sales efforts on customers more likely to subscribe, given the limited number of sales representatives available.

### 1.2. Challenge
The sales team needs to:
1. Maximize conversion rates to meet their goals.
2. Offer the most appropriate card for each customer based on predicted probabilities.

For example:
If customer A has the following probabilities:
- **70%** for the Star card,
- **20%** for the Nova card,
- **10%** for the Aurora card,

The salesperson will prioritize offering the **Star** card, reducing decision time and increasing the chance of success.

## 2. What is a Business Problem?
A business problem is any challenge that prevents a company from achieving its goals. In this project, the problem lies in optimizing customer outreach due to limited sales team capacity.

## 3. Solution Plan

### 3.1. Data Collection
- **Database Understanding**: Analyze available data sources.
- **Tool**: Use SQL to access and extract relevant customer information.

### 3.2. Data Analysis
- **Data Inspection**: Identify patterns, missing values, and relevant features.
- **Feature Selection**: Choose the most important variables for the model.
- **Data Preparation**: Ensure a clean and organized dataset.

### 3.3. Machine Learning Model Training
- **Predictive Model**: Train an algorithm to predict subscription probabilities for each card.
- **Results Presentation**: Deliver insights in a format that facilitates decision-making for the sales team.
